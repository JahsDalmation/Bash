This Package will install some additional packages for Arch
These Packages include:


The file Pkg-2.sh must be run from within the Pkg-2 directory
    This is because individual scripts are run from ./example.sh 
    ./ being the current directory, saves hassle such as writing
    the exact script location, also increases portability.
    For example:
    cd ~/Bash/Arch/Pkg-2
