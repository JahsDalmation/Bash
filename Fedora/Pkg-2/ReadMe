This Package will install some additional packages for Fedora
    These Packages include: 

The file Pkg-2.sh must be run from within the Pkg-2 directory
    This is because individual scripts are run from ./example.sh 
    ./ being the current directory, saves hassle such as writing
    the exact script location, also increases portability.
        For example:
        cd ~/Bash/Fedora/Pkg-2
        ~/Bash/Fedora/Pkg-2/Pkg-2.sh

All .sh files must be set as executable.
    The script/s will not run otherwise.
    This can be done from most file explorers.
        Right click file -> Preferences -> Permissions

If there are errors try:
    Reboot the system
    Update the system: sudo dnf makecache & sudo dnf update
        If the system needs to update remember to Reboot
