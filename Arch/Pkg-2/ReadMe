This Package will install some additional packages for Arch
These Packages include:
    Ibhagwans Picom | Picom.sh
    Spotify | Spotify.sh
    Optional packages | Optional.sh 

The file Pkg-2.sh must be run from within the Pkg-2 directory
    This is because individual scripts are run from ./example.sh 
    ./ being the current directory, saves hassle such as writing
    the exact script location, also increases portability.
        For example:
        cd ~/Bash/Arch/Pkg-2
        ~/Bash/Arch/Pkg-2/Pkg-2.sh

All .sh files must be set as executable.
    The script/s will not run otherwise.
    This can be done from most file explorers.
        Right click file -> Preferences -> Permissions
    In Arch, where you may not have a file manager:
        sudo chmod +x /full/path/to/example.sh
            E.g. sudo chmod +x ~/Bash/Arch/Pkg-2/Pkg-2.sh
        This will allow the script to be executable

If there are errors try:
    Reboot the system
    Or 
    Update the system: sudo pacman -Syu
        If the system needs to update remember to Reboot
