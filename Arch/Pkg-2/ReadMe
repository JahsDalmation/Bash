This Package will install some additional packages for Arch
These Packages include:


The file Pkg-2.sh must be run from within the Pkg-2 directory
    This is because individual scripts are run from ./example.sh 
    ./ being the current directory, saves hassle such as writing
    the exact script location, also increases portability.
        For example:
        cd ~/Bash/Arch/Pkg-2

All .sh files must be set as executable.
    The script/s will not run otherwise.
    This can be done from most file explorers.
        Right click file -> Preferences -> Permissions

If there are errors try:
    Reboot the system
    Or 
    Update the system: sudo pacman -Syu
        If the system needs to update remember to Reboot
