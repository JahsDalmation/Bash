This Package will install some essential packages for Fedora
These Packages include:
    Nvidia Drivers | Nvidia.sh 
    Spotify w/ EasyEffects | Spotify.sh
    Steam | Steam.sh 
    Gnome Tweaks & Extensions | Twk-Ext.sh 

The file Pkg-1.sh must be run from within the Pkg-1 directory
    This is because individual scripts are run from ./example.sh 
    ./ being the current directory, saves hassle such as writing
    the exact script location, also increases portability.
    For example:
    cd ~/Bash/Fedora/Pkg-1


All .sh files must be set as executable.
    The script/s will not run otherwise.
    This can be done from most file explorers.
    Right click file -> Preferences -> Permissions

If there are errors try:
    Reboot the system
    Update the system: sudo dnf makecache & sudo dnf update
    If the system needs to update remember to Reboot
