This Package will install some additional packages for Arch
    These Packages include:
        Nvidia Drivers | Nvidia.sh
        Xorg & Xinit | Xorg.sh
        Desktop Essentials | DEssentials.sh 
        i3-gaps WM | i3.sh
        

The file Pkg-1.sh must be run from within the Pkg-1 directory
    This is because individual scripts are run from ./example.sh 
    ./ being the current directory, saves hassle such as writing
    the exact script location, also increases portability.
        For example:
        cd ~/Bash/Arch/Pkg-1
        ~/Bash/Arch/Pkg-1/Pkg-1.sh

All .sh files must be set as executable.
    The script/s will not run otherwise.
    This can be done from most file explorers.
        Right click file -> Preferences -> Permissions
    In Arch, where you may not have a file manager:
        sudo chmod +x /full/path/to/example.sh
            E.g. sudo chmod +x ~/Bash/Arch/Pkg-1/Pkg-1.sh
        This will allow the script to be executable

If there are errors try:
    Reboot the system
    Or 
    Update the system: sudo pacman -Syu
        If the system needs to update remember to Reboot
