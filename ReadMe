Welcome back Jah!

This ReadMe is only an overview.
    Specific ReadMe's are avaliable within each Pkg.
    These go into much more detail about their operations.
    Alternatively, each script has been written with easy to
        understand commenting.

This repo is my personal hub for bash scripts.

As I am currently using Arch & Fedora, that is the scope of the scripts.
    Attempting to use scripts in the other/a different distro will very likely
        not work due to the way they function, particularly the package manager.
